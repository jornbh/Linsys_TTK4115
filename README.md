A basic guide tht will (Hopefully) make it easier to use plots in Matlab
(Or just copy the code you need)

##Running the guide
Open guide.m in the top folder
1. Run the entire script first (Or just run the init-section)
2. Find a plot that has something you need
3. The section corresponding to  (ctrl+f) to find the section ( It has the same name as the title of the plot)
4. T only run one section ( It is marked in yellow when your corsor is above it), hit (ctrl+enter)
    * The Plots can be run independently, as long as the init-part has been run



# Not implemented
Titles in Plots with multiple subplots
