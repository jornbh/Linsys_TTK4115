A basic guide tht will (Hopefully) make it easier to use plots in Matlab

## Running the guide
Open guide.m in the top folder
1. Run the entire script first (Or just run the init-section)
2. Find a plot that has something you need
3. The section corresponding to  (ctrl+f) to find the section ( It has the same name as the title of the plot)
4. T0 only run one section hit (ctrl+enter)
    * The current section is marked in yellow  your corsor is above it 
    * The Plots can be run independently, as long as the init-part has been run


## Getting data from the simulink-file
 * ???


# Misc.
* Close all plots with:
    * close all

## Not implemented
Titles in Plots with multiple subplots
Latex-code in the plots
